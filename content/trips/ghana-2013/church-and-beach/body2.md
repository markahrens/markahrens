Overall, it was a little tough to stay awake, the warm air combined with the rhythmic cadence of the language made it difficult. but there were enough times to stand or walk around that it made the 2 hours go by really quickly.

In the end, I couldn’t help but think of Will near the end of the service. They invited some of the kids to come up, introduce themselves and proclaim their faith to the whole church. After they did, the entire church gave an “Amen!” a few of the kids couldn’t have been much older than Will, so it just hit me a little harder.

## The Beach

My feet are covered in sand. We just had lunch at a resort called Kekes in the next town over. We headed there down a dirt road, easily the roughest ride we have had so far. We were greeted by another welcome sign, provided by Tigo, the cell phone provider. Then we drove another mile or so, through the mud until we turned down a road that had goats and children all over. The resort was nice, fresh fish for lunch, as well as a tomato sauce over rice that was fantastic. After we ate, we went down to the beach and played some Frisbee. It remains a blast to play, even if I am not quite so fast or agile as I used to be.

The beach was great, but it still wasn’t a complete escape from the poverty. As we were playing, we had to pause for a few minutes as a man carrying dried palm branches walked through. A couple of kids passed by too, even trying to toss the Frisbee with us. That being said, the beach was still amazing, the waves crashing was the only sound, with the warm air feeling perfect at the time.

We then came back to have some dinner. Yams, chicken and another tomato sauce. The yams were basically potatoes, not what we call yams sometimes at home. Combined with the tomato sauce, they were great. I am only ticked because I didn’t know there was fish available, so I missed that. At least I had some of the pineapple though.
