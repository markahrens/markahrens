As we got further from the airport, we had to drive through Accra to get to Winneba. The things I noticed on our night drive, not in any sort of order:

- Everyone honks, all the time. more of just a “hey” not being aggressive.
- Shacks on the side of the road. I still don’t know if they are housing or a place to sell their wares, but along the road, there would be 20 little shacks in a row.
- People, everywhere there were people walking around, congregating, dancing, etc
- Fluorescent blubs, I have not seen an incandescent bulb yet.
- There are no major highways. This meant we had to drive through all of Accra (at least it sure seemed that way) out of town. Looking on a map before we left, it is about 40 miles from Accra to Winneba, so I assumed maybe a 45 minute drive. instead, it was over 2 hours since we had to drive through stoplight traffic and security checkpoints nearly the entire way.

When we got to the hotel, it was just past 11 local time. The room does have an air conditioning unit as well as a ceiling fan. That was the good news. The bad news was there was no running water. This did get resolved pretty quickly though. After the long drive and the minor shock of the room, it started to hit me a little bit. Lots of “what have I gotten myself into” and a lot of “I miss my family so much”.  After a few minutes, I also figured out that in the course of the last 36 hours, I had only gotten 4 hours of sleep. I then hoped that some of this depression was a side affect of lack of sleep.

This morning, I can say that it was mainly the case. I am still in a bit of shock, but can handle it a lot better. It also helped to get a shower and shave in. off to breakfast and church, feeling more excited than nervous again, so that is good.
